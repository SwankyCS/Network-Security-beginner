#Purpose of this script: easily ping multiple IP Addresses by simply: 
        #copying the entire IP Range (including CIDR post-fix if applicable) and pasting into the script, or;
        #if the IP Addresses are already in a text file, link the absolute file path in option 2 below

#!/bin/bash

#OPTION 1:
#copy and paste ip ranges with the CIDR straight into the `iprange` variable
iprange=(<define IP ranges here>)

#for loop to ping each IP defined under the variable
for ip in ${iprange[@]}
do
        fping -g $ip
done

OPTION 2:
#alternatively, you can use the contents of a file to define the iprange variable
#for example, iprange=$(cat <absolute file path>/<file name>)

#for loop to ping each IP defined under the variable
for ip in ${iprange[@]}
do
        fping -g $ip
done
